ToDo's
======
* correct axes limits
  \+ done for main_plot
  \- for cut_plot need to calculate length along pit.cutline.
  \- for integrated_plot need to change class definition
* integrate along z
* (integrate along cutline)
* compare files -> session management?
* don't reset views (z and cursor position) when changing visual properties 
  (cmap, alpha)
* postprocessing
* save and export images and data
* reset to raw data (retain copy of original)
* colorbar histogram widget
* visual sliders (cscale, vmax, alpha)


Notes
=====
* PIT currently requires Qt5, i.e. PyQt5 installed! If there are several 
versions of PyQt present, the environment variable PYQTGRAPH_QT_LIB has to be 
set to `PyQt5`.

* maybe TracedVariable with allowed_values should be subclassed
