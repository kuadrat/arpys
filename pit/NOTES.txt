Bugs
====
* Intensity plot does not update on data.sig_value_changed. EDIT: seems fixed...
* gamma slider doesn't moueswheel beyond the center position at 0.5 (it's a 
feature?)


Notes
=====
* PIT currently requires Qt5, i.e. PyQt5 installed! If there are several 
versions of PyQt present, the environment variable PYQTGRAPH_QT_LIB has to be 
set to `PyQt5`.

* In the version of PyQtGraph that was used in development (0.10.0) the 
saving of plots from the context menu had a small bug (got a float for the 
size of the rectangle, where an int was expected). This was, in development, 
crudely fixed in the pyqtgraph source.
