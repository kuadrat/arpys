ToDo's
======
* don't reset views (z and cursor position) when changing visual properties 
  (cmap, alpha)
* correct axes limits
  \- Need to recenter ROI
     \- ROI setPos and setSize don't work the way one would expect.
* roll axes (i.e. change X-Y, Y-Z, Z-X representations)
* colormap powerlaw scaling (*gamma*)
* compare files -> session management?
* a 3D array slicing ROI
  \- implement a proper class for that (Cursor) EDIT: this is too time 
    consuming, just use a draggable LineSegmentROI instead.
* postprocessing
* reset to raw data (retain copy of original)
* colorbar histogram widget


Notes
=====
maybe TracedVariable with allowed_values should be subclassed
