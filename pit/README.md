PIT, the python image tool (for ARPES)
======================================

This should be a python based implementation of a data visualizer for ARPES 
data similar to the IGOR Image Tool used and developed at ALS, Berkeley or at 
SIS, PSI, Switzerland.
As opposed to the IGOR tools it should be open software and not rely on many 
dependencies, i.e. be easy to install on different systems.

List of required features
-------------------------

The final version should include the following functionality:

* quickly view (2D and) 3D (ARPES) data and take arbitrary slices thereof

* adjustable color scales and maps

* compare different sets of data easily (link views)

* apply postprocessing routines (bg subtractions, normalizations)

* make it easy to export current views to a format that can be used for 
publication quality plots

* allow inspection of metadata

* color ROI

* (switch between display modes XY, XZ, YZ)
