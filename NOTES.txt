When adding functionality to load and plot maps I inverted the typical data 
structure from (m x n x 1) to (1 x m x n). Consequently, all other 
postprocessing routines are broken.

The ability to plot both maps and cuts makes everything super complicated.
In combination with multiple z values for cuts this becomes unfeasible - this 
feature should thus be dropped.

The comment from 4.12.2017 does not seem justified anymore.

Fermi background subtraction somehow broken.

Fixed Dataloader_ALS very crudely with the ugliest of code. Need to clean up 
as soon as I get to it.
To problem to be fixed was that some maps (quick maps) use the keys `SFXXX` 
instead of `SSXXX` for their metadata...

The file .../171025_psi/Tl_1_0018.h5 (a hv scan) is not represented correctly 
in the gui.
