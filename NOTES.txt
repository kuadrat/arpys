When adding functionality to load and plot maps I inverted the typical data 
structure from (m x n x 1) to (1 x m x n). Consequently, all other 
postprocessing routines are broken.

The ability to plot both maps and cuts makes everything super complicated.
In combination with multiple z values for cuts this becomes unfeasible - this 
feature should thus be dropped.

Features and fixes needed:
* energy scale in map mode
X DONE Fermi level adjustment for cuts
X DONE cut2 ypadding
* integration range selector for maps

The comment from 4.12.2017 does not seem justified anymore.

Fermi background subtraction somehow broken.
